# Learn Auth the Hard Way

A scratchpad where I work through the [Learn Auth the Hard Way tutorial](https://www.andrew-best.com/posts/learn-auth-the-hard-way-part-one/).

## Running

### Run and configure the oauth server

```
make auth/run
make auth/open
```

If it's your first time running the server, compelte the [Setup Guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide).

I used the following Administrator Account credentials:
* **First name:** Yasha
* **Last name:** Podeszwa
* **Email:** ypodeswa@gmail.com
* **Password:** yasha-fusion-auth

### Run the fake application (relying party)

```
make app/run
make app/open
```
